BBS Analysis for rebar manufacturing, bend analysis, counting and diagram extraction

Go through the presentation pdf or project report for understanding the method and codebase

Code base consists of all the files used that I could search for in my system or on cloud.

The problem statement was reading of BBS files, detection of diagrams, number masking, removal, recognition and mapping them with edges, along with meta data (header, footer removal), table row and column detection, then bend analysis and counting, including edge cases of overlapping bends, intersecting bends, merging patches, corner detections, spiral bends and semi circular bends with flagging for uncertainity. 

Some parts of the project may still be incomplete or not available here on github, but feel free to contact me if required for some help.

Thank me later :)
